Hi Artyom here and I'll be talking about Ai effects on workflow!!! 

Our group decided to see how AI would affect the workflow and if it would improve or decline in work speed.

To do this we created a demo project in visual studios in which we coded the sumEvenUpTo() function and tested out the workflow speed before implementing help from AI vs after implementing AI,

Since ai is a program that can mimic behavior of the user and learn the coding habits, it will analyzing the code the user writes, the Ai then can help speed up the work by providing predictions of the correct code and points out any mistakes in the code that the user might have missed  this will help the coding for the sumEvenUpTo() function  to be more quicker and less mistakes will appear and to show how this works we will show recording of the demo.

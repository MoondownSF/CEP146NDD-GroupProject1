# **Qusetion&Answer**
- As CPA and CPP students, when should we use AI and when should we avoid it in Code, Review, and Test so we gain speed without losing understanding?

- **Answer:**
- My personal view is that we are at an junior stage of learning. We need to understand the logic and memorize the formulas. These fundamentals need to become muscle memory for us. Whether in coding, review, or testing, we should try to solve problems on our own. This way we will know where we fall short and then improve ourselves.

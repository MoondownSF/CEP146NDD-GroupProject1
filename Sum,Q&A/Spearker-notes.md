#Spearker notes:
- Hi, I am Frank, I’ll first add a bit about AI’s efficiency improvements in Visual Studio.
  
- After I enable GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio, when I work on this incorrect code, I just need to right-click where the error is and choose “Ask Copilot,” and it gives the correct answer.
  
- Another pretty striking thing is the AI’s completion feature.
  
- When I only type a function name, the AI shows the most commonly used function code.

- In summary, AI has a very significant impact on programmers’ efficiency

- For basic, potentially repetitive coding, it can be extremely helpful, but it can also lead many people to become overly dependent on AI

- like choosing auto-login after entering a password and, over time, forgetting the password. When AI isn’t available, those who are overly dependent on it may no longer be able to complete code independently.

- Our question, as CPA and CPP students, when should we use AI and when should we avoid it in Code, Review, and Test so we gain speed without losing understanding?

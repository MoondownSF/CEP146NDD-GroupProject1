#Spearker notes:
- Hi, I am Frank.
  
- In summary, AI has a very significant impact on programmers’ efficiency

- For basic, potentially repetitive coding, it can be helpful, but it can also lead many people to become overly dependent on AI

- It's same like choosing auto-login after entering a password and over time, forgetting the password. When AI isn’t available, those who are overly dependent on it may no longer be able to complete code independently.

- Our question is: As CPA and CPP students, when should we use AI and when should we avoid it in Code, Review, and Test so we gain speed without losing understanding?
